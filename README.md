# Dynamic-Load-Balancing-on-Linux-Private-Cloud
The work has proposed a policy engine to dynamically balance the load over the network. Originally the network was imbalanced. There were hosts in heavily as well as lightly loaded bands. After some iterations on the VM of the load balancing algorithm, all the hosts were balanced over the network i.e. all the hosts were balanced.
